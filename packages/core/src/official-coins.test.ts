/**
 * OFFICIAL COINS — the listing itself, and the three things it must never become.
 *
 * Most of these are shape tests on a constant, which is exactly what they should
 * be: the whole value of a pinned listing is that it does not depend on a
 * running chain, a discovery window, or a table that gets pruned. What a test
 * CAN prove is that the pinning is internally consistent and that the listing
 * cannot leak into the registry paths that would break it.
