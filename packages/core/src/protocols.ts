 *
 * WHY A CONSTANT AT ALL, when the grant already seals the factory it was signed
 * against. Because RECOVERY may have no grant. `merrymen recover` accepts a
 * pasted owner key with nothing else, and it can also run against an ARCHIVED
 * grant — so the vault has to be derivable from the owner key alone, and the
 * only missing input is the factory. Without this, an owner who lost their
 * machine could not reach class positions they still own.
 *
 * A DEPLOY CONSTANT FOR RECOVERY, and the distinction matters more here than for
 * the adapters: recovery signs with the sudo validator and is NOT bound by the
 * wall, so a settings-supplied factory would let a settings write redirect where
 * a recovery goes looking — and since the vault address is a CREATE2 function of
 * the factory, that points the sweep at a contract holding nothing while the
 * real position sits elsewhere. Recovery consults ONLY this table, which is what
 * makes that true.
 *
 * "NEVER A SETTING" IS WHAT THIS USED TO SAY, AND IT WAS HALF WRONG. Signing
 * does read a setting: `ponsClassVaultFactory` exists (settings.ts:134-149,
 * whose own docstring calls it "a hint at signing time") and session.ts gives it
 * PRECEDENCE over this constant. So an owner can seal a grant against any
 * factory address they paste, and the two paths can disagree — which is a real
 * asymmetry and not a bug to be fixed by deleting the setting, because a
 * settings write must never be able to steer a recovery.
 *
 * What makes the signing side safe is not that the setting cannot exist. It is
 * that the signer PROVES what answered before it seals anything
 * (`probeClassFactory`), since the two vault versions are selector-identical and
 * nothing downstream can tell them apart. A false claim here is worse than no
 * claim: someone reads it, believes the setting path cannot happen, and stops
 * checking the one place it does.
 *
 * `null` means "no class route on this chain", which is a different fact from

 * PonsClassVaultFactoryV2 — the factory whose vaults hold ONE CEILING PER QUOTE
 * ASSET. Deployed on mainnet 2026-09-16; testnet is `null` and will stay that
 * way until the deploy script has a per-chain quote table, which it does not.
 *
 * A SECOND CONSTANT, NOT A REPLACEMENT, and the v1 table above must never be
 * emptied. A v1 vault is a deployed contract at a CREATE2 address derived from
 * the v1 factory, and it may be holding a position right now. Recovery is the
 * reason the constant exists at all — `merrymen recover` can run from a pasted
 * owner key with no grant, deriving the vault from the factory — so deleting v1
 * here would not tidy anything up. It would make a real balance unreachable by
 * the one path built to reach it without a grant. Both must be probed.
 *
 * WHY THE VAULT WAS VERSIONED RATHER THAN RETUNED. v1 holds a single spend cap
 * in raw units, 250_000_000, which is 250 USDG at 6 decimals — and it charges
 * every buy against that one number whatever asset funded it. The chain never
 * restricted the quote: the vault accepts any ERC-20 equal to the curve's own
 * `pairToken()`, and the only thing pinning buys to USDG is a wall constraint
 * off chain. So a five-dollar entry in an 18-decimal share hands the vault about
 * 2.8e16 against a ceiling of 2.5e8, and is refused by eight orders of magnitude
 * in the one place no off-chain fix can reach. v2 keys the ceiling to the asset
 * it is denominated in, and the cap doubles as the allowlist: zero means refused.
 *
 * WHAT A V2 ADDRESS DOES NOT UNLOCK. Nothing about multi-quote execution follows
 * from deploying this. The vault would ACCEPT a non-USDG entry and every other
 * layer would still refuse one — the wall pins the buy's quote word, the
 * producer filters candidates to USDG, and the ledger books `quoteIn` as USDG at
 * 6dp. That ordering is deliberate: the contract is the layer that cannot be
 * corrected later, so it moves first and alone.
 *
 * Same rules as v1 in every other respect, including the one worth restating
 * because it is easy to misread: this table is what RECOVERY consults, and only
 * this table, which is what keeps a settings write from redirecting a sweep at a
 * contract holding nothing. SIGNING is different — it prefers the owner's
 * `ponsClassVaultFactory` setting over this constant, so an owner can seal a
 * grant against a factory that is in neither table. The signer's job is
 * therefore to PROVE what answered rather than to trust where the address came
 * from, because v1 and v2 are selector-identical and a v1 address pasted here
 * would seal a wall that looks correct and enforces a global ceiling.
 *
 * And `null` means "no v2 class route on this chain", which stays
 * distinguishable from "the factory answered zero".

 * never the authority", and the delivery path proves the point: the web
 * `GET /api/settings` returns the stored blob with no default merged in, the
 * phone signer has no settings fetch wired at all, and the worker's
 * `MERRYMEN_PONS_ADAPTER_ADDRESS` sits on the far side of the boundary where it
 * can only raise a drift warning. So every owner who never pasted an address
 * signed a grant with no Pons route, and the weekend curve fallback — shipped,
 * tested, and the documented remedy for all 24 equity feeds going stale — could
 * not fire for anybody on the platform.
 *
 * A DEPLOY FACT, which is what makes a constant right rather than merely
 * convenient: this address is decided once per chain by whoever ran the deploy,
 * it is identical for every tenant, and no tenant has information about it that
 * the platform lacks. That is the same argument PONS_CLASS_VAULT_FACTORY makes
 * above, and the two should be read together.
 *
 * PRECEDENCE IS GRANT-FIRST, EVERYWHERE. The worker calls whatever address the
 * signature SEALED (`grantPonsAdapter`), never this. This is consulted only when
 * a grant is being MINTED, as the default a signer offers when the owner has not
 * named one — so a redeploy can never redirect an existing grant's trades, and
 * a settings entry still wins over it for an owner who has a reason to differ.

 * The adapter a NEW signature should carry: the owner's own choice, or nothing.
 *
 * THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT FALL BACK TO `PONS_SELF_TRADE`, and the reason is a
 * threat-model change rather than a bug in the adapter.
 *
 * It briefly did fall back, so that the weekend curve fallback could work
 * without every owner pasting an address. What that missed: the curve is a
 * caller-supplied argument that the wall CANNOT pin — ~475 new curve addresses
 * an hour, so there is no set to enumerate — and `PonsSelfTrade.tradeExactIn`
 * gives that address a live ERC-20 allowance over the pulled input
 * (PonsSelfTrade.sol:225) before calling it. Meanwhile the stock-token and
 * owner-extra `approve` permissions carry NO amount condition
 * (wall.ts:485, `args: [{ONE_OF: spenders}, null]`), and the adapter is in
 * `spenders`.
 *
 * So a COMPROMISED SESSION KEY — not a third party, and not an honest agent —
 * can approve the adapter for an unbounded amount of an enumerated asset, call
 * `tradeExactIn` naming a contract it controls as the "curve", and have that
 * contract take the tokens. The output check is satisfied by returning one wei
 * of another enumerated asset, since `minAmountOut` is unpinned. The on-chain
 * ops cap that would have bounded repetition does not exist: RateLimitPolicy is
 * codeless on 4663, so `maxOpsPerDay` is worker-enforced only (wall.ts:871-897).
 *
 * That converts a worker compromise from "can churn the portfolio" — every sale
 * already being permitted, with `transfer` pinned to registered withdrawal
 * addresses — into "can exfiltrate the portfolio". V4SelfSwap does not have this
 * shape: it pins its PoolManager as an immutable, because there is exactly one
 * singleton to trust. A Pons curve has no singleton, which is the whole reason
 * the argument is unpinnable.
 *
 * The adapter stays deployed and remains reachable for an owner who sets
 * `ponsAdapterAddress` themselves — an explicit, informed choice for curve
 * tokens they have vetted. What is withdrawn is the SILENT default, which would
 * have widened every grant signed from now on without the owner choosing it.
 *
 * Returns `undefined` rather than a zero address for "none", because every
