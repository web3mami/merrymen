/**
 * READING CONTRIBUTED CAPITAL OFF THE CHAIN, for every hosted account at once.
 *
 * This is the evidence source the ledger should always have had. `chain-log` has
 * no producer in production — the deposit scan defaults off — so every one of the
 * 363 flow rows in the shared database is `inferred` with no transaction, and a
 * quarantine-only repair would leave every agent at zero contributions. The rows
 * that SHOULD be there have to come from somewhere, and this is where.
 *
 * TWO PASSES, AND THE SECOND IS THE EXPENSIVE ONE.
 *
 *   1. One `eth_getLogs` sweep for the whole fleet. Topic positions accept an
 *      OR-list, so twenty-four accounts cost what one costs.
 *   2. One receipt per DISTINCT transaction the sweep touched. That is what
 *      `classifyUsdgMovement` needs: a swap is two tokens moving opposite ways in
 *      one transaction, and the second leg is only visible in the receipt.
 *
 * The receipts are what make this correct rather than merely cheap. Without them
 * the canary's four router outflows read as a 6.666 USDG withdrawal, and its
 * contributed capital comes out at 3.334 instead of 10.
 *
 * COVERAGE IS PART OF THE ANSWER. A sweep that could not read a window returns
 * `complete: false`, and a caller that writes rows on an incomplete scan would
 * be inserting a contribution history with holes in it — which is worse than the
 * inferred rows it replaces, because it would look authoritative.
