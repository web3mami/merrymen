/**
 * THE TWO WAYS A NODE SAYS NO, AND WHY THEY WANT OPPOSITE ANSWERS.
 *
 * The first version of this sweep retried every failure four times at the same
 * size, 700ms apart, on the reasoning that "a rate limit is not a hint about the
 * question". That reasoning is right and it is half the story. Run against the
 * live chain it failed all 110 of its windows with 429 Too Many Requests — while
 * the identical query for a single account across the WHOLE 54.7M-block history
 * succeeded in 1.6 seconds. The node was refusing the RATE, not the range, and
 * windowing was what created the rate.
 *
 * So the sweep now starts with the whole range and narrows only when the node
 * says the answer was too big, which is the one refusal that splitting can fix.
