/**
 * IS THIS CALLDATA A WITHDRAWAL, OR JUST SOMETHING THE HOUSE WOULD PAY TO RELAY?
 *
 * Validating the method, the entryPoint, the paymaster fields and the sender does
 * not make a relay "a recovery submit path" — none of those look at what the
 * operation DOES. Without this check, anyone holding a ticket can push arbitrary
 * UserOperations for their own account through app.merrymen.dev: swaps,
 * approvals, any contract call on the chain, as a free transaction-submission
 * service running on the house's bundler account. Refusing that structurally is
 * cheaper than defending it with quotas.
 *
 * THE SHAPE recover.ts BUILDS: N ERC-20 `transfer(to, amount)` calls with zero
 * value, optionally followed by ONE bare value transfer with empty calldata, and
 * every leg paying the SAME destination. That last part is what makes it a
 * withdrawal rather than a payment — money leaves for one address the caller
 * nominated and nothing else happens on the way.
 *
 * DECODED THE WAY KERNEL ENCODES IT, read out of the installed SDK rather than
 * assumed. `execute(bytes32 execMode, bytes executionCalldata)`, where execMode's
 * first byte is the call type:
 *
 *   0x00 SINGLE — executionCalldata is PACKED: to(20) ++ value(32) ++ data
 *   0x01 BATCH  — executionCalldata is abi.encode((address,uint256,bytes)[])
 *   0xFF DELEGATE — refused outright; a delegatecall is not a withdrawal
 *
 * The single form matters and is easy to miss: encodeCallData switches on
 * `calls.length > 1`, so a recovery that sweeps ONE token is not a batch at all.
 * A decoder that only understood batches would strand exactly the simplest case.
 *
 * FAIL CLOSED, BUT PINNED. A false reject here strands somebody's money, so the
 * test feeds this the output of the SDK's OWN encoders — a Kernel encoding change
 * then fails a test rather than quietly turning this into an escape hatch or a
 * wall.
