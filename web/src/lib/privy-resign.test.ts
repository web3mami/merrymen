/**
 * A RE-SIGN AND A BRAND-NEW AGENT ARE THE SAME CALL WITH A DIFFERENT OWNER.
 *
 * The Kernel address derives from the sudo validator alone, so `mintGrant` run
 * with an owner that is not the one an agent was minted under produces a
 * different address — quietly, successfully, with no error anywhere. The caller
 * hands the server a valid grant for an account holding nothing, while the
 * funded account it meant to re-sign keeps its old wall and its money.
 *
 * That was survivable while the only re-sign path was `restoreAgentWallet` with
 * a key read out of THIS grant: same key, same account, by construction. It
 * stops being survivable the moment a Privy owner can re-sign, because
 * `usePrivyOwner` returns whichever embedded wallet is connected RIGHT NOW —
 * and a different Privy login in the same browser is a different owner.
 *
 * The other half of this file is the invariant Wallet.tsx states about itself
 * and had not finished keeping: "ONE SIGNING CONTROL, ONE SET OF CONDITIONS,
 * and everything else points at it."
