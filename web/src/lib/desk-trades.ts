 * resolve a side by matching the executed pair against STOCK_TOKENS, so every
 * curve and class trade arrived with no side at all, the desk kept only buys
 * and sells, and an agent that had bought and sold CASHCAT and CHUMP showed its
 * owner "Trades · 0" — while the chat model was handed action null and symbol
 * null and could not say what it had just bought.
 *
 * The join is the one profile-trades.ts already uses, and the rows are
 * collapsed to one per operation for the same reason as there: a redeploy's
 * re-recorded copies must not head the owner's tape either.
 *
 * Kept out of the route so it can be driven against a real ledger in a test.
