/**
 * ONE SWAPS TABLE, FOR A STRANGER AND FOR THE OWNER — its rules, where a test
 * can run them.
 *
 * The public profile rendered each fill as a four-line article ("Not realized
 * on a buy" under every buy, a full date, three footnotes, no coin), and the
 * owner's desk had its own list of every row of any status, so thirty ops-cap
 * refusals pushed the owner's actual fills off the screen. Both now build the
 * same rows and render them with SwapsTable.tsx:
 *
 *  - a Buy or Sell pill, the coin and its name, and a relative age with the
 *    full date on hover;
 *  - DOLLARS ONLY WHERE THEY MAY BE SHOWN: the owner's own desk, or a profile
 *    whose owner published the book. The server already withholds a private
 *    book's sizes; the table refuses to print one it was handed anyway;
 *  - a P&L chip on sells only — a buy realizes nothing, and saying so on every
 *    buy was noise;
 *  - REFUSALS COLLAPSED, per reason, into one muted "Tried" line placed where
 *    the newest of them happened: "Refused 12× today: past today's number of
 *    trades". The owner is still told every refusal and why — hiding refusals
 *    from the owner is the one thing this may not do — just not thirty times.
